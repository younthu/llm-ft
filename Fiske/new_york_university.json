        "With the world at its doorstep, New York University invites its student body to jump right in. Firmly planted in the heart of Greenwich Village, one of the most eclectic and energizing neighborhoods in New York City, NYU has set its sights on becoming the world’s first truly global university. Its growing student body, burgeoning new facilities, and multiple opportunities for high- level internships and research projects have made it a top option for a rising number of students. “Our dorms are like city apartments, and our walk to class is on city sidewalks and across busy streets,” says a business and political economy major. “Going to NYU prepares students to live and work in the real world.”",
        "It doesn’t get more real world than the venue that NYU has called home since its founding in 1831. NYU has campuses and centers throughout the city but is primarily situated on Washington Square. Trendy shops, galleries, clubs, bars, and eateries crowd neighboring blocks; SoHo, Little Italy, and Chinatown are just blocks away. Academic buildings— both modern and historic— blend with 19th- century brick townhouses surrounding Washington Square Park (the closest thing NYU has to a quad). NYU’s library is one of the largest open- stack facilities in the country, with millions of volumes. Kimmel Center for University Life houses meeting space for hundreds of student organizations, plus areas for the frequent recruitment fairs and lectures from national and international leaders. It also holds the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts’ 860- seat theater, which is the largest performing arts facility south of 42nd Street. The brand- new, $1.2 billion Paulson Center is a massive, 735,000- square- foot multiuse facility on Mercer Street. Completed in spring 2023, the complex features classrooms, practice and performance spaces for the drama and music programs, a world- class sports center complete with a six- lane pool, housing for 400 freshmen and 42 faculty members, dining facilities, a Commons for meet- ups and studying, and more.",
        "The city scene is central to the NYU experience. So, too, is the wide range of academic programs. Under the College Core Curriculum, freshmen and sophomores take courses including foreign language, expository writing, foundations of con-temporary culture, and foundations of scientific inquiry. The language offerings go far beyond the typical Spanish- French- German— among the choices are Arabic, Cantonese, Hindi, Modern Irish, Swahili, and Tagalog— and NYU operates a lan-guage exchange program with Columbia University as well. The Tisch School of the Arts trained such famed artists as Martin Scorsese, Spike Lee, Donald Glover, and Maggie Rogers, and current undergrads continue to win many national student film-maker awards. Tisch also boasts excellent drama, dance, photography, and televi-sion departments, and it’s not uncommon to see students who haven’t yet finished B.F.A. degrees performing in Broadway shows.",
        "Wall Street’s future bull and bear wranglers hang out at the Stern School of Business, where they benefit from unique interdisciplinary majors such as business and political economy and business, technology, and entrepreneurship. The Leslie eLab also provides space for aspiring entrepreneurs. Another favorite department among students (and the New York corporations who recruit them after graduation) is accounting, known for its high job- placement rate. In the College of Arts and Science, economics, English, journalism, history, politics, and global liberal stud-ies win the highest marks from students. The Tandon School of Engineering, the Steinhardt School, the Silver School of Social Work, the College of Nursing, and the School of Professional Studies offer a bevy of career- based programs, including engi-neering, education, media, nutrition, and real estate. Steinhardt’s offerings in music, music theatre, and music business are notable. Across the university, the most pop-ular majors are business, nursing, economics, and theatre. The Gallatin School of Individualized Study provides flexible schedules and freedom from requirements for those wishing to engage in independent study or develop their own programs. For those tempted to linger around the Village for more than four years, there’s a seven- year dental program and several five- year bachelor’s/master’s programs.",
        "Finding a cheap New York apartment may be easier than sailing through NYU’s challenging academics. Regardless of major, everyone is very focused on career preparation— it’s never enough to just concentrate on your classes. “It’s common for students to take on difficult courseloads, along with a job or internship,” explains a film and television major. Despite the university’s mam-moth size, 58 percent of classes taken by under-graduates have fewer than 20 students. Graduate students might lead foreign language sections, writing workshops, and the recita-tions that accompany lectures, but students still say teaching is usually top- notch and professors are reasonably accessible. “Surprisingly, most of our introductory courses are taught by really great and well- known professors,” says one student.",
        "Point to a spot on a world map and you’ll likely hit a country hosting under-graduates from NYU, which sends more of them abroad than any other school. “At NYU, studying away is not a matter of ‘if,’ but ‘where,’” says a junior. In addition to its campuses in Abu Dhabi and Shanghai, the university has 12 academic sites in cities from Buenos Aires and Prague to Sydney and Tel Aviv, as well as exchange agreements with universities in other locations throughout the world. More than half of NYU undergrads study abroad, sometimes as early as their freshman year through the university’s Liberal Studies Core. Locally, internships range from jobs on Wall Street to assignments with film industry giants. The career center is “amaz-ingly personal and well run,” says an econ major, and has thousands of listings for on- campus jobs, full- time jobs, and internships. Students qualifying for freshman honors seminars study in small classes under top faculty and eminent visiting pro-fessors. An annual undergraduate research conference at the College of Arts and Science gives students the chance to present findings from their research.",
        "An international politics major says NYU students are “high- achieving individuals, cosmopolitan, independent, self- driven, and confident.” Thanks in part to the universi-ty’s investment in student housing, 67 percent of undergraduates now come from out-side New York State, including a substantial 26 percent from outside the United States. In- staters hail primarily from the city and nearby sub-urbs. Black students make up 8 percent of undergrads, Asian Americans 20 percent, Hispanics/Latinos 17 percent, and multiracial students 4 percent. On this generally liberal campus, social justice, immigration policy, the Israeli- Palestinian conflict, and rights of all kinds— LGBTQ, animal, human, and workers’— are important, students say. Although most financial aid is need- based, merit awards averaging $28,500 are available; athletic scholarships are not.",
        "Whereas NYU students once had to fend for themselves in New York’s outrageous housing market, the university now guarantees four years of housing to all fresh-men (and most transfers) who seek it. More than 20 residence halls, ranging from old hotels to a converted monastery, provide a wide range of accommodations. Most rooms have private baths and are larger, cleaner, newer, and better equipped than many city apartments, enticing 36 percent of students to stay in campus- owned hous-ing. Opines a senior, “Housing is lovely although expensive, like everything else in Manhattan.” First years reside largely in first- year residence halls, many of which have themed floors, and rooms are assigned by lottery each spring. The university provides free shuttle buses to dorms that are farther uptown or downtown. The dining halls offer extensive choices— from wraps to sushi to a dedicated kosher eatery. “The dining halls really try to accommodate everyone,” says one student. Of course, downtown’s array of ethnic restaurants also offers a variety of food at cheap prices.",
        "Because NYU is large and fairly decentralized, the Student Resource Center helps students navigate university resources and services. The university’s Wellness Exchange provides students with a hotline that connects them with professionals who can help them address daily challenges or crises they may encounter, and S.P.A.C.E. (Sexual Misconduct Prevention, Assistance, Counseling, and Education) provides comprehensive resources and support. Students also meet with academic advisors— usually professors in their major department— at least once a semester. For concerned parents and students, NYU hosts a series of workshops on keeping safe, and programs like the NYU Trolley and Safe Ride Van Service provide door- to- door service for students until 3:00 a.m. “I always feel safe,” says a linguistics major. “I can’t walk more than one block without seeing an NYU secu-rity officer or an NYPD car just patrolling the area.”",
        "NYU’s social life is divided between the campus and the city. “Students can be found all over the Village and NYC enjoying one of the most vibrant social scenes on the planet,” enthuses a romance languages and psychology major. Many students march in the city’s Halloween Parade, which takes over the Village, while most fall and spring weekends find a city- sponsored street fair somewhere nearby. On campus, there are concerts, movies, fraternity and sorority events (only 2 percent of the men and 4 percent of the women go Greek), and more than 300 clubs and organizations. Underage students caught with alcohol in public areas in the dorms may lose their housing. The rest take their chances with the notoriously strict bouncers at bars and clubs around Manhattan. The springtime Strawberry Festival includes free berries, cotton candy, outdoor concerts, and carnival amusements. The Violet Ball, a dinner/dance held each fall in the atrium of Bobst Library, offers an excuse to get dressed up. “We graduate at Yankee Stadium, which is incredible,” cheers a senior.",
        "While sports have not traditionally been a big emphasis at NYU, successful Violets programs include women’s golf (recent national champions), volleyball, and basketball, as well as men’s and women’s fencing and swimming and diving, all of which compete in Division III. Roughly one- third of undergrads participate in intra-mural sports, which include flag football, bowling, and indoor cricket.",
        "The heartbeat of New York City thumps day and night; NYU students thrive on all that energy and know how to capture it in their studies and social lives. “To be an NYU student is to be part college student, part New Yorker,” a senior says. “Don’t left: 94.5___left___come here if you’re not up to working hard and moving fast.”"
